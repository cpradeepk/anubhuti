## 🎯 **Optimized Workflow Overview**

### **Phase 1: Training (Dedicated AI Machine)**
```bash
# On your powerful AI training machine
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpradeepk/anubhuti/main/train_on_dedicated_machine.sh | bash
```

### **Phase 2: Deployment (Raspberry Pi)**
```bash
# On each Raspberry Pi
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpradeepk/anubhuti/main/deploy_pretrained.sh | bash
```

---

## 🔧 **Detailed Implementation**

### **Step 1: Training on Dedicated Machine**

#### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+ with pip
- 4GB+ RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- Internet connection for dependencies
- Optional: NVIDIA GPU for faster training

#### **Training Process**
```bash
# Download and run training script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpradeepk/anubhuti/main/train_on_dedicated_machine.sh
chmod +x train_on_dedicated_machine.sh
./train_on_dedicated_machine.sh
```

#### **What the Training Script Does**
1. **System Check**: Verifies Python, memory, CPU, GPU availability
2. **Environment Setup**: Creates isolated training environment
3. **Dataset Verification**: Validates audio dataset completeness
4. **Model Training**: Trains YAMNet classifier (2-3 minutes)
5. **Model Validation**: Tests trained model functionality
6. **Deployment Package**: Creates ready-to-deploy model files
7. **Training Report**: Generates comprehensive training summary

#### **Training Output**
```
deployment_package/
├── yamnet_classifier.h5          # Trained model (26MB)
├── yamnet_classifier.h5.sha256   # Integrity checksum
├── model_info.txt                # Model metadata
└── yamnet_model_metadata.json    # Configuration
```

### **Step 2: Model Transfer**

#### **Option A: Direct Upload to GitHub (Recommended)**
```bash
# From your training machine
cd anubhuti
cp yamnet_implementation/yamnet_models/yamnet_classifier.h5 .
git add yamnet_classifier.h5
git commit -m "Add trained YAMNet model"
git push origin main
```

#### **Option B: SCP Transfer**
```bash
# Transfer to Raspberry Pi
scp deployment_package/yamnet_classifier.h5 pi@your-pi-ip:~/
```

#### **Option C: USB Transfer**
1. Copy `yamnet_classifier.h5` to USB drive
2. Insert USB into Raspberry Pi
3. Copy model to Pi storage

### **Step 3: Pre-trained Deployment on Raspberry Pi**

#### **One-Command Deployment**
```bash
# SSH into Raspberry Pi and run:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpradeepk/anubhuti/main/deploy_pretrained.sh | bash
```

#### **What the Deployment Script Does**
1. **System Check**: Verifies Raspberry Pi compatibility
2. **Package Updates**: Installs system dependencies
3. **Repository Setup**: Clones code (no training data needed)
4. **Dependencies**: Installs inference-only Python packages
5. **Model Download**: Downloads pre-trained model from GitHub
6. **Model Testing**: Verifies model loading and functionality
7. **Audio Config**: Sets up microphone input
8. **Summary**: Generates deployment report
