# Audio Classification System - Progress Log

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Create a complete audio classification system for sound-to-vibration project
- **Input:** Human vocal commands ("soo" and "humm" sounds)
- **Output:** Classification into 4 rhythm categories (disturbance, slow, medium, fast)
- **End Goal:** Real-time audio classification for Arduino motor vibration control

## Dataset Structure
Expected folders:
- `disturbance/` - Class 0
- `slow/` - Class 1
- `medium/` - Class 2
- `fast/` - Class 3

## Technical Specifications
- Audio format: .wav files
- Sampling rate: 22050 Hz
- Audio duration: Normalized to 3 seconds
- Features: MFCC with 13 coefficients
- Model: DS-CNN with Dense layers
- Classes: 4 (0=disturbance, 1=slow, 2=medium, 3=fast)

## Progress Log

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [x] Created progress log file
- [x] Set up task management system
- [x] Check for dataset folders
- [x] Create dataset folders if needed
- [x] Created README.md with comprehensive documentation

### Phase 2: Preprocessing Script
- [x] Create dataset_preprocess.py
- [x] Implement audio loading with librosa
- [x] Implement 3-second normalization (pad/truncate)
- [x] Implement MFCC feature extraction
- [x] Implement label creation based on folder names
- [x] Implement data.json saving with specified structure
- [x] Add error handling and progress bar

### Phase 3: Training Script
- [x] Create train_model.py
- [x] Implement data loading from data.json
- [x] Implement train/test split (80/20)
- [x] Implement DS-CNN model architecture
- [x] Implement model compilation and training
- [x] Implement model saving as model.h5
- [x] Add training metrics display

### Phase 4: Testing Script
- [x] Create test_model.py
- [x] Implement model loading from model.h5
- [x] Implement command-line argument handling
- [x] Implement audio preprocessing for inference
- [x] Implement prediction and confidence display
- [x] Add error handling for invalid inputs

### Phase 5: Integration Testing
- [x] Created all required scripts and documentation
- [ ] Test preprocessing with sample data (requires audio files and virtual environment)
- [ ] Test training pipeline (requires preprocessed data)
- [ ] Test inference pipeline (requires trained model)
- [ ] Verify end-to-end functionality (requires complete setup)

## Notes
- Original description mentions 19 classes but current structure supports 4 classes
- All MFCC parameters must be consistent across scripts
- Consider Arduino integration for future motor control commands
- Virtual environment already set up with required packages

## Issues and Solutions

### Completed Development Issues:
1. **Script Creation**: All three core scripts successfully created
   - dataset_preprocess.py: Complete with MFCC extraction and JSON output
   - train_model.py: Complete with DS-CNN architecture and training pipeline
   - test_model.py: Complete with inference and confidence scoring

2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation created
   - README.md with full usage instructions
   - Progress log with detailed tracking
   - Inline code comments and error handling

### Current Setup Requirements:
1. **Virtual Environment**: Need to activate virtual environment with required packages
2. **Audio Data**: Need to add .wav files to dataset folders for testing
3. **Package Installation**: librosa, tensorflow, scikit-learn, etc. need to be installed

### Next Steps for User:
1. Activate virtual environment (mentioned as already created)
2. Install required packages: `pip install librosa numpy soundfile scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib tqdm`
3. Add audio files to dataset folders (disturbance/, slow/, medium/, fast/)
4. Run the complete pipeline

## Next Steps
1. Create dataset folders if they don't exist
2. Implement dataset_preprocess.py
3. Implement train_model.py
4. Implement test_model.py
5. Test complete pipeline
